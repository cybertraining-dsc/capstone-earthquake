## Todo

- [X] Review IEEE Presentation
- [ ] Review MLCommons 
- [ ] Use jabref for citation management
- [ ] Review Fox paper
- [ ] Frequently check github
- [ ] Read up on TFT
- [ ] Become familiar with the Attention Paper
- [ ] Learn how to selfdeploy jupyterlab
- [ ] Begin to learn about papermill (https://github.com/nteract/papermill)
- [ ] virtualenv on rivanna for a particular python version.
      - Rivanna's core configurations might be a bit limited on this front.  They do provide multiple versions of software (such as py2.7 and py3.8), but we may need to get permission to do something in userspace if we need to be very specific on a version of python outside of a container image.
- [ ] depends on Tensorflow
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with Rivanna's modules (https://lmod.readthedocs.org/) and conda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environments.
      - Some details are already captured in [Rivanna Notes](./docs/rivanna-notes.md)
- [ ] Look into horovod (https://github.com/horovod/horovod)
- [ ] Look into mlkube for contract-container deployments for the reference model and its dependencies (https://github.com/mlkube/mlkube)
      - [ ] Get familiar with Signularity as a container engine (not the same as docker).
- [ ] pytorch (although, the initial codebase is written to tensorflow)
